# VolunteerHub iOS App 📱🌎

This repository contains the swift code of the VolunteerHub iOS App. VolunteerHub is an app for iOS and Android, that offers volunteers a platform in which they can easily find volunteer activities around their area, making it possible for them to start helping others right way!

## How to run the project? 💻

For running the app in a simulator, please follow the steps shown below:

1. Clone the repository. 
    - Cloning the repository may take a long time given that all of the thir-party libraries files are contained in the repo.
    - This project uses Cocoa Pods dependencies manager, so if you don't have it on your computer please download it. 
    - Configure the 'pod' terminal command as well.
2. Open the terminal and go to the `root` 📁 directory of the project. 
3. Run the following command: `open VolunteeringHub.xcworkspace`. (This command will open XCode project)
    - The `/Pods` directory contains all of the third-party libraries, so you won't need to execute any additional commands.
        - In case you encounter yourself with any errors when trying to execute the project in XCode, do the following:
            - Delete the `/Pods` directory as well as the `VolunteeringHub.xcworkspace`.
            - Go to the `root` directory of the project and run `pod install`. (This command will download all of the third-party dependencies and will create the `/Pods`, the `Podfile.lock`, as well as the `VolunteeringHub.xcworkspace`)
4. Having XCode open, run the project in the simulator of the iPhone device you desire. (Most of the testing was done using an iPhone 11 simulator).
